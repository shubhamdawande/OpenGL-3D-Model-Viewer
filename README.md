3D Model Viewer - Android
==========================

This is a demo android app built using OpenGL min3D library to render 3D models on to screen. Models are user interactable (zoom and rotate feature). Supported format for the 3D model is 'xyz.obj'. Currently models are embedded inside the app and external model preview is not present.
